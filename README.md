# scrappey-web-api-cloudflare-solver-bypass
Scrappey: The Web Scraping API to make everything easier. Showcase for my personal GitHub portfolio. Bypass and solve Cloudflare, Datadome and all anti-scrape.

This website was created using my open-source project, the Vue3-Tailwind-Flowbite-Starter-Kit. It leverages Vue 3, Tailwind CSS, Flowbite, and Vite to provide a solid foundation for building modern web applications. Also features a white/dark mode.

Features
- Web Scraping API: Scrappey.com offers a web scraping API that handles all the anti-bot bypassing tasks, including rotating proxies, Cloudflare bypass, headless browsers, and CAPTCHA solving.
- Built-In Anti-Bot: With Scrappey.com's API, you can make up to 10 million requests without being noticed as a scraper. It eliminates Access Denied screens that often occur during scraping.
- Scrape pages behind Cloudflare: The service allows you to scrape web pages protected by Cloudflare within 15 seconds, bypassing the protection.
- Simple, No-Nonsense Pricing: The pricing structure is straightforward and transparent, with payment based on the number of requests made (per 1000 requests). There are no hidden fees.
